# Coding workflow preferences

- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- do not change versions of implemented frameworks etc - only if really necessary - make sure, the whole project has the same versions of the implemented tech (framework, etc)
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly structed
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
-Ensure that the documentation is always current and informs users about new features. After the implementation of new features, the `readme.md` must be updated to document the new functionalities and their usage.
